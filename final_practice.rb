# Defining Our Own Methods
# For each exercise below, write the method according to the requirements. 
# Call each method at least twice and store the return value in a variable. 
# Use the puts or print command to see the return value in the console.

# What is the return value of your method?
# How many arguments did you pass your method?

# How many arguments did you pass your method?
